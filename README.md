# HashCode 2018
My solution for the Google Hash Code 2018 qualification round problem. It consisted in the multi-vehicle pickup and delivery problem with time windows.

You can check the problem statement [here](statement.pdf).

## How to run

Build with:
`javac src/*/*.java`

Once the code is built it runs with the command:
`java src.simulacion.Main`

To clean the build files:
`rm src/*/*.class`
